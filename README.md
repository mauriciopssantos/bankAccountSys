# bankAccountSys
We'll work in a bankAccountSystem project to exercise our understanding of Python classes.

Our bank system will have the following features:
  1 - Customers can view their account details:
      - Type of account
      - Available balance
      - Interest rate on available loans
      - credit/debit statements
  2 - Customers can check their transaction history:
      - Transaction date/time
      - Transaction type
      - Transaction amount
      - Display the amoung of deposited/withdrawn cash.
